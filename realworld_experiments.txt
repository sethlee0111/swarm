    tried with max delegations = 1. Not a good result, but the scale is too small yet. 
    deployed a much longer version of the experiment. > 12 hours expected.

    turns out that I was running mnist, not cifar. changed graph filename. 
    greedy-no-sim still performing the best. probably because it's taking as much as it can 
    while others only opportunistically collaborate. Still, too short an experiment to see the performance diff.

    why does the mnist decrease? there is a difference with realworld dataset from controlled experiments that 
    the data is the same throughout the experiment, but still, momentum performs worse than greedy and it decreases
    which hasn't been observed in controlled experiments.

    the clients get a fresh set of training data. momentum still performing not good. Because clients do not meet
    randomly? How does meeting the same guy multiple times help greedy?

    max delegations = 6 must have caused this dip. Also, explains why momentum performed well in the PerCom paper.
    if max delegations = 1, then both performs better than this but greedy is better. can't figure out why...
    change the setting to completely randomized?

    the upper one with max delegations = 1. to confirm.

figs/realworld_mnist_online_4.pdf
    tried with longer duration ("encounter_data/levy_walk_client_45_epi_10_dur_5000.pickle") to ensure more randomness

figs/realworld_mnist_online_5.pdf (!)
    "encounter_data/levy_walk_client_45_epi_500_dur_50.pickle"
    shows good performance. but not entirely sure why this works well
    Let's first try completely randomized experiment first.

figs/cifar_new_1.pdf
    CIFAR10 with long-epi/short-duration (levy_walk_client_45_epi_1000_dur_50.pickle). However, the momentum approach
    just gives up in the middle. -> look into individual clients
    does not update local data (not online)
    HYPERPARAM: noise-label-set-size 2 (try with 3)

figs/cifar_new_2.pdf
    tried with HYPERPARAM: 3, and levy_walk_client_45_epi_500_dur_50.pickle

figs/realworld_mnist_re_2.pdf
    ..in re_1 jsd-momentum didn't perform as good. changed factor from 2 to 4.
    maybe I should try staleness and minmax here..
